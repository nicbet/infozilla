Build: I-20030710
I found the exception pasted below in my log file.  Note that 
org.eclipse.debug.core/.classpath is indeed in my workspace.

Comment 1 Philippe Mulet 2003-07-14 07:51:18 EDT
Exceptions come from platform, the file claims to not be local.
How did the classpath file get created ? Imported through CVS or created 
through PDE import ?

Comment 2 Wassim Melhem 2003-07-14 09:56:12 EDT
The classpath file in question was created during the PDE import operation.

Hello Wassim,
Wasn't it funny to work again together in Eclipse project after WMQI? ;)
I'm currently tracking this bug but have lot of difficulties to recreate it. 
I've imported 58 external plugins several times and never got this exception...
Would it be possible to have your test case or a more precise idea of a 
scenario to reproduce this problem and have a chance to understand what happen 
here?
Thanks

Comment 5 Wassim Melhem 2003-09-01 14:50:48 EDT
Frederic,
You and I worked on the same project such a long time ago that WMQI was still 
called MQSI ;-)

This bug is difficult to reproduce, as I think it has to do with timing.  
However, it did happen to me more than once.

I think this bug has to do with the two-stage plug-in import operation, and 
the fact that half-way through the operation, JDT core and PDE are fighting 
for cpu time.

Below is a modified excerpt of a note that I sent to Philippe as a follow-up 
to the then-critical bug 37274.  The note explains what happens during import, 
and with an appendix explaining what I think could be causing this particular 
bug.


Here is a breakdown of the activities that take place during the plug-in 
import operation:

1. If autobuilding is on, we turn it off.

2. We import all the plug-ins selected in the import wizard and create a Java 
project for each plug-in that contains libraries.  Note that at this step, we 
used to clear the classpath of the freshly created Java project because we 
will correctly set it at a later step.  However, just before we released 2.1, 
Philippe suggested in bug report 34574 that we do not flush the classpath 
completely.  So we stopped flushing the classpath at this point, and this 
introduced the transient error markers that we now see in the Problems view in 
the middle of the operation.  Since these error markers go away later in step 
3 when we set the classpath, we regarded them as benign, yet still annoying, 
intermediary entities.  This step is done in an IWorkspace.run
(IWorkspaceRunnable, IProgressMonitor) operation.

3. We set the classpath of all the projects that were succesfully imported 
into the workspace. This step has to be done in a subsequent IWorkspace.run
(IWorkspaceRunnable, IProgressMonitor) operation for an accurate classpath 
computation.  i.e. the Java projects from step 2 have to become part of the 
workspace before we set their classpath.

4.  If we had turned autobuilding off in step 1, we turn it back on and invoke 
a build via PDEPlugin.getWorkspace().build
(IncrementalProjectBuilder.INCREMENTAL_BUILD,new SubProgressMonitor
(monitor,1));

Note that after step 2, JDT core and PDE start doing stuff simultaneously and 
competing for CPU (bug 31592).  JDT starts the indexing work, while PDE starts 
setting classpaths.  So what I think might happening in this instance is that 
JDT wants to index the classpath file for org.eclipse.debug.core before PDE 
had a chance to create it or set it.

Comment 6 Philippe Mulet 2003-09-03 05:58:08 EDT
What is suspicious though is that if you did not flush the classpath, then the 
file should live on disk, and should be readable. However the platform refuses 
to let us access it.

Anyway, since this is only a logging problem, and we believe our indexer 
activity should be fault tolerant (given it is running after the fact), we 
modified our code to be more resilient in this scenario, and stop logging this 
problem, which isn't one in the end.

Fixed

Comment 7 Frederic Fusier 2003-09-03 11:54:25 EDT
While testing PDE external plugins import, I got another similar exception in 
the indexer:

Comment 8 Frederic Fusier 2003-09-03 11:56:53 EDT
Created attachment 5960 [details]
Fix also exception raised while getting output location

We have similar problem with output location than with raw classpath getter
=> apply similar solution.

Comment 9 Frederic Fusier 2003-09-04 05:07:16 EDT
Wassim,

About the unnecessary markers displayed between step2 and step3, there's 
nothing we can do avoid them as the projects were created without classpath 
during step 2. At the end of the operation performed while this step, a 
PRE_AUTO_BUILD event is sent and processed by our DeltaProcessor which 
refreshes all markers of resources concerned by the delta.

As these resources are the created and they have no .classpath file, there's 
automatically a  marker created to signal this problem.

I think there are two solutions here to have these markers not displayed:

1) perform the import in only one operation as suggested by bug 31592
2) add a temporary .classpth to the project to avoid markers creation while 
treating PRE_AUTO_BUILD event between the two operation


I'm not sure if solution 1) is possible, but I've made a try to implement 
solution 2) by modifying method createProject(...) in PluginImportOperation 
class.
I've replace following code:
if (isJavaProject) {
	/*IJavaProject jProject = JavaCore.create(project);
	if (jProject.getRawClasspath() != null
		&& jProject.getRawClasspath().length > 0)
		jProject.setRawClasspath(new IClasspathEntry[0], monitor);*/
	modelIds.add(model.getPluginBase().getId());
}

with:
if (isJavaProject) {
	IJavaProject jProject = JavaCore.create(project);
	jProject.setRawClasspath(new IClasspathEntry[0], project.getFullPath(), 
monitor);
	modelIds.add(model.getPluginBase().getId());
}

And it seems to work properly (import does not hang and no markers are 
displayed bewteen two steps).

May you let me know if you get same result with this change?

Thanks

Comment 10 Frederic Fusier 2003-09-04 05:19:40 EDT
Wassim,

About markers displayed between step 2 and step 3 there's nothing to do on our 
side about it. At the end of step 2, a PRE_AUTO_BUILD event is sent by the 
running operation and processed by our DeltaProcessor which refreshes markers.

As project were created in step 2 without classpath, then we correctly create a 
markers for each concerned project that its .classpath cannot be read.

As it seems necessary to keep the two separated operations, I suggest to set 
the classpath to the created project in order to avoid these markers to be 
displayed.

I've made a try modifying createProject(...) method of PluginImportOperation.
At the end of the method I've changed the if(isJavaProject) block as follow:
if (isJavaProject) {
	IJavaProject jProject = JavaCore.create(project);
	jProject.setRawClasspath(new IClasspathEntry[0], project.getFullPath(), 
monitor);
	modelIds.add(model.getPluginBase().getId());
}

After that, I've made several import operation with new or replacing projects 
and never got any dead lock nor transient error markers :)

Let me know if this change could be acceptable for you, thanks

Frédéric

Comment 11 Philippe Mulet 2003-09-04 05:23:45 EDT
Transient classpath problem markers are expected due to the PDE import process, 
and should be avoided so as to improve user experience, but this is on the PDE 
side only.

Integrated fix for output location as well.
Fixed.

Comment 12 Wassim Melhem 2003-09-04 12:43:46 EDT
Frederic,
Your suggested fix is exactly what I had once upon time, but this solution, 
which is perfect for me, seems to have caused unnecessary re-indexing for JDT 
core (bug 34574).  Are you suggesting that it is no longer a problem for JDT 
Core if I flush the classpath completely?

Comment 13 Philippe Mulet 2003-09-05 06:28:36 EDT
We think we have corrected the exposed problem on JDT side by 2.1, this being 
said it triggers quite a lot of activity in an intermediate state, so I am no 
longer convinced it is the best move.

Still worth investigating though, as it could avoid creating transient problems.

Comment 14 David Audel 2003-10-14 10:13:14 EDT
Verified.
